# ESD Protection Device ‚Äì D1Z1-D2 Diode Design for Automotive Applications

This repository contains the research work and supporting materials for designing a **low-capacitance, high-performance ESD protection device** tailored for 15V Local Interconnect Network (LIN) transceivers in automotive systems. The work was conducted as part of a research initiative at the **Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Gandhinagar**.

## Project Overview

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) events, resulting from sudden electrical surges, can permanently damage integrated circuits in electronic devices. Automotive systems, particularly LIN transceivers operating at 15V, require ESD protection devices that provide **low clamping voltage** and **low capacitance** to preserve signal integrity while ensuring device reliability.

This project presents a **3-diode D1Z1-D2 structure** that enables independent tuning of capacitance and dynamic resistance without compromising the required breakdown voltage. Through TCAD-based simulations, the design demonstrates:

‚úî ~64% reduction in capacitance  
‚úî ~38% reduction in dynamic resistance  
‚úî Maintained 15V breakdown voltage for robust protection

## Problem Statement

High capacitance in conventional ESD protection diodes causes significant insertion loss and limits frequency performance, degrading signal quality. Automotive communication networks such as LIN buses are particularly vulnerable to such disturbances.

**Key challenges addressed in this project:**
- Balancing low capacitance with effective ESD protection
- Achieving low clamping voltage without increasing device area
- Optimizing geometry through oxide width and P+ diffusion tuning

---

## Objectives

- Develop an ESD protection diode structure with minimal parasitic capacitance
- Maintain low clamping voltage to prevent device breakdown
- Use geometry optimization (oxide length and P+ diffusion) to independently tune capacitance and resistance
- Validate performance through TCAD simulations (TLP and CV analyses)

## Technical Background

### Single Diode Limitations
A single PN junction diode with large area offers low clamping voltage but results in high junction capacitance, which degrades communication signals.

### D1Z1-D2 Structure
The proposed three-diode structure separates clamping and capacitance functions by:
- Using a small-area diode (D1) for forward current paths
- Enlarging Z1 area to improve ESD protection without increasing capacitance
- Using a lower breakdown diode (D3) to manage reverse stress events

### Geometry Optimization
- **Oxide Length Tuning**: Reduces junction capacitance by increasing the effective oxide area, thus lowering parasitic effects without compromising breakdown voltage.
- **P+ Diffusion Optimization**: Independently adjusts dynamic resistance while preserving current capacity and reliability.
